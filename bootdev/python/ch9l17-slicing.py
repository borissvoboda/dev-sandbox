scores = [50, 70, 30, 20, 90, 10, 50]
# Display list
print(scores[1:5:2])
# Prints [70, 20]

Omitting sections
You can also omit various sections ("start", "stop", or "step"). For example, numbers[:3] means "get all items from the start up to (but not including) index 3". numbers[3:] means "get all items from index 3 to the end".

numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
numbers[:3] # Gives [0, 1, 2]
numbers[3:] # Gives [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Using only the "step" section
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
numbers[::2] # Gives [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
