Pages vs App Router - those two ways exist for the historic reasons.

Both options - fullstack, ssr, file system for routing.

But Pages router is older, very stable. Covered in depth in course.

App Router - relaitvely new way, from Next 13. But newer and somehow buggy.
(Next 13 has been released 26 Oct 2022. Oct 2023, Next.js 14 has been released. 
14.2.6 was released at 8/2024.)

App Router supports modern Next and rteact features -> fullstack React apps. It is the 
dedicated way for the future of NextJS.
