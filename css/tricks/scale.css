/* traditional way to scale elements in CSS, using the transform property with the scale() function.
The scale() function scales the element by the provided factor. In this case, the element will be scaled to twice its original size.
It is part of the transform property, which can also include other transformations like rotate(), translate(), etc.
Browser Support: transform has wide browser support, including older browsers.
*/

.item {
  transform: scale(2);
}

/* 
This is a newer way to scale elements introduced in the CSS Transforms Level 2 specification (???).
The scale property is shorthand for directly setting the scaling transformation. It is similar to using transform: scale(), but it's more specific and does not support other transformations like rotate or translate within the same declaration.
